<h3>My first website</h3>
<h6>22.06.25</h6>
<p>This is my first website that I created using HTML and CSS.
    At the beginning, it was difficult to understand how everything works.
    I learned how to use basic tags, links, and simple styles.
    Step by step, I started to understand the structure of a web page.
    This project helped me feel more confident in web development.
    I want to continue learning and improve my skills.</p>

<h2 id = "entry2">CSS is very useful in web!</h2>
<h3>23.06.25</h3>
<p>CSS is a very useful tool for creating modern websites.
    It helps control colors, fonts, and layouts, making pages look clean and attractive.
    With CSS, a website becomes easier to read and more enjoyable to use. It also allows developers to separate design from content.
    Thanks to CSS, the same page can look different on various devices.
    Learning CSS is an important step for every web developer.</p>
